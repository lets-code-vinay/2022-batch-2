//  * 5.
//  * A company insures its drivers in the following cases.
//  * - If the driver is married.
//  * - If the driver is unmarried,males&above 30 years of age.
//  * If the driver is unmarried,females&above 25 years of age.
//  * 
//  * In all others cases, te driver is not insured.If the marital status ,sex and age of 
//  * driver are the inputs,write a program to determine whether the driver should be injured or not.

//  * Here after checking a complicated set of instruction the final output of the program would be one
//  * of the two-either he driver should be insured  or the driver should not be insurd.As mentioned
//  * above,since these are the only two outcomes this problem can be solved using logical oprators.
//  * But before we do that,let us write aprogram that does not make use of logial opretors.
