          An old man lived in the village. He was one of the most unfortunate
          people in the world. The whole village was tired of him; he was always
          gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood. The
          longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more
          <span>poisonous</span>
          were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became
          contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to
          him. He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.
