            <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.
                 Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
                  a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, <br/>
                   a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though,
                    the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is <br/> what constitutes a paragraph. <br/>
                     A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” 
                     <b>(Lunsford and Connors 116)</b>. Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a
                      paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles,
                      <br/> a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of
                        sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the
                         <i> “controlling idea,”</i> because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph</p>
