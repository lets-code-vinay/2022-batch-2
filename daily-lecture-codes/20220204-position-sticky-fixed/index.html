          An unincorporated area is a region that is not governed by a local
          municipal corporation.[1] Similarly, an unincorporated community is a
          settlement not governed by its own local municipal corporation, but
          administered as part of larger administrative divisions, such as a
          township, parish, borough, county, city, canton, state, province, or
          country.[citation needed] Occasionally, municipalities dissolve or
          disincorporate, which may happen if they become fiscally insolvent,
          and services become the responsibility of a higher administration.
          Widespread unincorporated communities and areas are a distinguishing
          feature of the United States and Canada.[citation needed] Most other
          countries of the world have either no unincorporated areas at all, or
          these are very rare; typically remote, outlying, sparsely populated,
          or uninhabited areas.

          By country Argentina In Argentina, the provinces of Chubut, Córdoba,
          Entre Ríos, Formosa, Neuquén, Río Negro, San Luis, Santa Cruz,
          Santiago del Estero, Tierra del Fuego, and Tucumán have areas that are
          outside any municipality or commune. Australia Unlike many other
          countries, Australia has only one level of local government
          immediately beneath state and territorial governments. A local
          government area (LGA) often contains several towns and even entire
          cities. Thus, aside from very sparsely populated areas and a few other
          special cases, almost all of Australia is part of an LGA.
          Unincorporated areas are often in remote locations, cover vast areas,
          or have very small populations. Postal addresses in unincorporated
          areas, as in other parts of Australia, normally use the suburb or
          locality names gazetted by the relevant state or territorial
          government. Thus, any ambiguity regarding addresses rarely exists in
          unincorporated areas. Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia are
          entirely partitioned into LGAs and have no unincorporated areas.
          Australian Capital Territory The Australian Capital Territory (ACT)
          has no municipalities. The territorial government is directly
          responsible for matters normally carried out by a local government. In
          some countries, this arrangement would be referred to as a unitary
          authority, but the Australian Bureau of Statistics refers to the whole
          of the ACT as an unincorporated area.[1] New South Wales The far west
          and north of New South Wales constitutes the Unincorporated Far West
          Region, which is sparsely populated and barely warrants an elected
          council. A civil servant in the state capital manages such matters as
          are necessary. The second unincorporated area of this state is Lord
          Howe Island. Northern Territory In the Northern Territory, 1.45% of
          the total area and 4.0% of the population are in unincorporated areas,
          including the Unincorporated Top End Region (the largest), areas
          covered by the Northern Territory Rates Act, Nhulunbuy, the community
          of Alyangula on Groote Eylandt in the northern region, and Yulara in
          the southern region.[2] South Australia In South Australia, 60% of the
          area is unincorporated and communities located within can receive
          municipal services provided by a state agency, the Outback Communities
          Authority.[3] Victoria Victoria has 10 small unincorporated areas,
          which are either small islands directly administered by the state or
          ski resorts administered by state-appointed management boards.[2]
          Canada See also: Unorganized area In Canada, depending on the
          province, an unincorporated settlement is one that does not have a
          municipal council that governs solely over the settlement. It is
          usually, but not always, part of a larger municipal government. This
          can range from being a small hamlet to being a large urbanized area
          that is similar in size to a town or city. For example, were they
          incorporated, the urban service areas of Fort McMurray in the Regional
          Municipality of Wood Buffalo and Sherwood Park in Strathcona County
          would be the fifth- and sixth-largest cities in Alberta. In British
          Columbia, unincorporated settlements lie outside municipal boundaries
          entirely, and are administered directly by regional/county-level
          governments similar to the American system. Unincorporated settlements
          with a population between 100 and 1,000 residents may have the status
          of designated place in Canadian census data.[4] In some provinces,
          large tracts of undeveloped wilderness or rural country are
          unorganized areas that fall directly under the provincial
          jurisdiction. Some unincorporated settlements in such unorganized
          areas may have some types of municipal services provided to them by a
          quasigovernmental agency such as a local services board in Ontario. In
          New Brunswick, where a significant population lives in a local service
          district, taxation and services may come directly from the province.
          Czech Republic Sign prohibiting entry to the Military Area Boletice
          The entire area of the Czech Republic is divided into municipalities
          (obce, sg. obec), with the only exception being four military training
          areas. These are parts of the regions and do not form self-governing
          municipalities, but are rather governed by military offices (újezdní
          úřad), which are subordinate to the Ministry of Defence. Military area

          was abandoned by the army in 2015 and converted into a Landscape park,
          with its area being incorporated either into existing municipalities
          or municipalities newly established from the existing settlements. The
          other four military training areas were reduced in size in 2015 too.
          The decisions on whether the settlements join existing municipalities
          or form new ones are decided in plebiscites.[5] Denmark Ertholmene,
          named so because they are small as a pea (Danish, ert, (modern) ært)
          form the easternmost part of Denmark. This small archipelago lies 20
          kilometers northeast of Bornholm. Population of less than 100.
          Statistics Denmark groups them with Bornholm in Landsdel Bornholm.
          Germany Since Germany has no administrative level comparable to the
          townships of other countries, the vast majority of the country, close
          to 99%, is organized in municipalities (German: Gemeinde, plural
          Gemeinden), often consisting of multiple settlements that are not
          considered to be unincorporated. Because these settlements lack a
          council of their own, usually an Ortsvorsteher or Ortsvorsteherin
          (village chairman / chairwoman) is appointed by the municipal council,
          except in the very smallest villages. In 2000, the number of
          unincorporated areas in Germany, called gemeindefreie Gebiete
          (municipality-free areas) or singular gemeindefreies Gebiet, was 295
          with a total area of 4,890.33 km2 and around 1.4% of its territory.
          However, these are mostly unpopulated areas such as forests, lakes and
          their surroundings, military training areas, and the like. As of 31
          December 2007, Germany had 248 uninhabited unincorporated areas (of
          which 214 are located in Bavaria), not belonging to any municipality,
          consisting mostly of forested areas, lakes, and larger rivers. Also,
          three inhabited unincorporated areas existed, all of which served as
          military training areas: Osterheide and Lohheide in Lower Saxony, and
          Gutsbezirk Münsingen in Baden-Württemberg. They had fewer than 2,000
          inhabitants in total. After losing its inhabited parts to adjacent
          municipalities on 1 January 2011, Gutsbezirk Münsingen is now
          uninhabited.[6] Largest The following shows the largest unincorporated
          areas in Germany (including all inhabited areas, but excluding lakes)

          – † No inhabitants since 1 January 2011 as a result of reduction in
          area. In Bavaria, there are other contiguous unincorporated areas
          covering more than 50 km2; these are however composed of several
          adjacent unincorporated areas combined, each of which is however under
          50 km2 in area. Israel In Israel, almost all land is subdivided into
          393 municipalities which are further classified, normally by
          population, as city, local council, or regional council. All three
          types of municipality provide services including zoning and planning.
          However, a few unincorporated areas exist, whether because of
          omissions and ambiguities left in official maps dating from the
          British Mandate for Palestine, or due to deliberate policy of ensuring
          facilities of national importance, such as Ben Gurion Airport, Mikveh
          Israel boarding school, or the BAZAN Group oil refineries, would not
          have their operation affected by local considerations. The largest
          unincorporated area in Israel is the so-called "Reservation area", a
          triangular region whose vertexes are Beersheba, Dimona and Arad, in
          which all Negev Bedouins were concentrated in the 1950s. As no
          municipal services are provided within unincorporated area, this
          effectively makes all Bedouin settlements in the area unrecognized,
          with the sole exception of those included within the Abu Basma
          Regional Council. Netherlands The Netherlands has had regular periods
          with unincorporated land when newly reclaimed land polders fall dry.
          Unincorporated land is since medieval times administered by an
          appointed officer with the name Landdrost or Drossaart. Also, Elten
          and Tudderen, both annexed from Germany after World War II, were
          governed by a Landdrost until they were ceded to Germany in 1963. The
          most recent period with unincorporated land started in 1967, when the
          dyke around Southern Flevoland was closed, but several years are
          required before the polder is genuinely accessible for cultivation,
          and construction of roads and homes can start, as in the first years,
          the soil is equivalent to quicksand. During the initial period of
          inhabitation, a special, government-appointed officer was installed,
          the Landdrost. During the administrative office of a Landdrost, no
          municipal council forms. In 1975, the first homes in what is now the
          city of Almere were built, and from 1976 to 1984, the area was
          governed by the Landdrost as the executive of the Openbaar Lichaam
          Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders (Southern IJsselmeerpolders Public Body).
          In 1984, the Landdrost became the first mayor of the new city Almere.
          Since that date, the Netherlands does not have any unincorporated land
          areas. The Openbaar Lichaam remained, however, only governing the
          water body of the Markermeer. After the municipal division of the
          Wadden Sea (1985), the territorial waters in the North Sea (1991) and
          the IJsselmeer (1994), all water bodies are now also part of a
          municipality[7] and no unincorporated areas exist in the Netherlands
          anymore. The Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders was
          dissolved in 1996. Norway
